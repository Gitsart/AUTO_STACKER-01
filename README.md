# AUTO_STACKER-01
AUTOmatic stacking machine for cloth piece STacking. Project done and machine installed for RAymonds factory KA.
All codes are written in ARduino IDE. Using C.
Components required includes stepper motors drives axis for tray sensor systems switches and Arduino MEGA.
ALl SCHEMATICS TO BE INCL.
All RIghts REserved. 

Final programmes running on each axis at production. Any changes at service is updated here.

All axis have same configuration and same connections. (Except A5)

Any program for one axis will satisfy logic needs of other axis.

Exceptional case is axis 5 which is reverse of all 1 to 4.

Maintain separate program for A5.
